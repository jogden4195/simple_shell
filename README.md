## Goals of this project
At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / "end-of-file"?
